# Web Crawling

## 1) List up the items and price at price.com (HK) 

There is a Hong Kong website, price.com (https://www.price.com.hk/), which can search the items and prices listed by Hong Kong different shops. 

This function helps users to list up the searching result by applying web crawling. 

A dictionary will be return by listing up the item names and relevant prices shown in price.com. 

By inputing your requested keyword, like price_dot_com("dyson"), the relevant dictionary will be returned. 

Be careful that the input should be in string, which means quotation marks ("" or '') is required outside the keyword itself. 

Also pay attention that it may takes more time due to your keyword, so please be patient until the crawling is finished.
