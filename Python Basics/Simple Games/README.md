Several games and exercises completed during learning and practicing Python.

## 1) Guess A Number 

A game to let the player guess a random number generated by the computer. 

To start the game, you may input the lower bound and upper bound by your choice. 

For example, check_ans(1, 99). The game will be started accordingly by generating an answer from 1 to 99. You may try 20 times for one game. 

Try to guess the correct number until the limit is reached!

### 2) Paper Scissors Rock 

A tradional game in our childhood, maybe also a game for us to decide our priority in some condition. 

The rule is simple:

If both the player and the computer input the same answer, it would be a tie. 

To start the game, you may enter the number of rounds that you prefer to play. 

For example, check_ans(10). 

A 10-rounds game will be strated accordingly, after 10 rounds, you will find out who wins the game finally.
