# Exercises
Some simple exercises completed during the training.

## 1) An exercise in dictionary.py
A simple exercise applying dictionary data structure, by inputing a list of numbers, the function will return the number which only appears once from the list. For example, by running: the_only_one([1,2,3,2,1], the function will return 3 as it only appears once from the list.

## 2) Various Exercise.py
Various exercises done in the python lesson.

* Fibonacci 

A Python program to get the Fibonacci series between 0 to i. i has to be >= 1 and is input by user. The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦

Example: 

Input: 10 

Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

* Factorial 

A program which can compute the factorial of a given number. And then write a program to return the series of factorials from 1 to n, given an input of integer n. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Example: 

Input: 8 

Output: [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320]

* Common prefix 

A function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1: 

Input: ["flower","flow","flight"] 

Output: "fl"

Example 2: 

Input: ["dog","racecar","car"] 

Output: ""

* Check if a list if numbers return wheter any two sums to the input number 

Given a list of numbers, return whether any two sums to k. 

For example, given [10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.
